When I was in middle school, I have some interest in computers. Fast forward 12 years later, I am working at a public high school doing tech support stuffs from configuring computer network, servers, and even making some basic applications. All self-taught from the Internet, and from blowing some fuses 😂 Last month I turned 26 years old. I decided I will starts working as a professional software developer. So I applied to a coding bootcamp before my birthday, and after some interviews I got admitted to their training and job placement program 🎉 The course will start this month, and hopefully I will be able to finish the program just before new year. I will document my new journey on this blog to remind me later in life how much I grow as an engineer and as a person.
